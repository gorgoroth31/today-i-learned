### How to connect with iwd to my school network

My school network uses [8021x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1X) where you need to enter your credentials instead of a PSK. When i tried to connect to it on my laptop running omarchy, i ran into the error net.conman.NotConfigured. After a bit of digging, i stumbled across a [github issue](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/issues/2076), which resolved my error. Important was checking the settings on my phone, because i needed to set the anonymous identity aswell. The following code snippet is the current config file:

```conf
[Settings]
EAP-Method=PEAP
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Method=MSCHAPV2
EAP-Identity=my.email@my-school.de
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Identity=my.email@my-school.de
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Password=MyPassword
```
