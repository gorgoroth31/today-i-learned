## How to reset password for immich database (if forgotten)
I had the issue today, that somehow my .env file was not anymore in the directory of my immich instance. So i downloaded the example file, but after starting the containers, i couldn't access the web interface, nor could my phone connect to the instance. After a bit of troubleshooting, it appeared, that i set the DB_PASSWORD to the wrong value, but i wasn't able to get the correct one, so i needed to reset the password.
1. Enter the DB container:
`docker compose exec database bash`

2. Connect to postgres:
`psql -U postgres` (postgres is here the value DB_USERNAME from the .env file)

3. Reset password:
`ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword'`

4. Update .env to 'newpassword'

5. Restart everything:
````
```
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
